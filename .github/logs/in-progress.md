# Validation Alignment Progress (as of July 2, 2025)

## Completed
- Added custom validation annotations: `@ValidTeam` and `@ValidGoals`.
- Implemented `ValidTeamValidator` and `ValidGoalsValidator` to ensure only valid enum values are accepted.
- Applied these annotations to `team` and `goals` fields in both `FriendCodeSubmissionRequest` and `FriendCodeUpdateRequest` DTOs.
- Now, invalid values for these fields will trigger user-friendly validation errors instead of generic deserialization errors.


## Completed (as of July 2, 2025)
- All relevant unit and integration tests pass with the new validation logic.
- Error responses for invalid team/goals values are now user-friendly and follow the expected error format.
- Controller tests for invalid enum values have been added and pass successfully.
- Validation alignment is now complete and all requirements are satisfied.

Validation alignment is complete. No further action required unless new requirements arise.
